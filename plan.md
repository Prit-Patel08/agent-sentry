# FLOWFORGE — MASTER INFRASTRUCTURE COMPANY PLAN (Execution-Control Platform)

Date: 2026-02-20  
Owner: Founder + Product + Engineering + Reliability + Security  
Company Direction: Local-first execution control infrastructure for AI and automation workloads

---

## 0) Why This Document Exists

This document replaces previous planning documents with one authoritative operating plan.

This is not a feature brainstorm.
This is a build-and-scale doctrine for turning FlowForge into a durable infrastructure company.

If any roadmap or idea conflicts with this plan, this plan wins.

---

## 1) Founder Intent (Authoritative)

FlowForge is being built as a serious infrastructure company, not a side tool.

Core thesis:
1. AI and automation workloads need deterministic execution control.
2. Teams need explainable interventions, not black-box auto-fixes.
3. Trust is earned through evidence, reproducibility, and disciplined operations.
4. Expansion is gated by reliability metrics, not by hype.

---

## 2) Strategic Positioning

FlowForge becomes:
- an execution-control platform
- a guardrails and policy platform
- an evidence and observability platform
- a reliability discipline system
- an integration surface embedded in developer workflows

FlowForge does not become:
- a generic cloud monitoring company
- a broad AI orchestration SaaS in early stages
- a features-first product without reliability proof

---

## 3) Company Blueprint (Final 10 Domains)

Domain 1: Execution Runtime Guard (Core)  
Domain 2: Decision Intelligence Engine  
Domain 3: Policy and Governance Plane  
Domain 4: Evidence and Audit Plane  
Domain 5: Observability Plane (Execution-Centric)  
Domain 6: AI Cost and Model Intelligence  
Domain 7: Agent Runtime Platform (Advanced)  
Domain 8: Security and Trust Infrastructure  
Domain 9: Reliability Engineering System  
Domain 10: Ecosystem and Integrations

---

## 4) Technical DNA (Non-Negotiable)

1. Deterministic over probabilistic.
2. Explainable over opaque.
3. Guardrails before autonomy.
4. Reliability over velocity theater.
5. Evidence before claims.
6. Versioned everything.
7. Rollbackable everything.
8. Operational ritual over ad-hoc heroics.

---

## 5) Explicit Non-Goals (Current Horizon)

For the next 12 months, FlowForge will NOT:
1. launch multi-tenant SaaS hosting.
2. add billing-first product tracks.
3. ship black-box AI auto-remediation.
4. expand integrations faster than reliability baseline allows.
5. ship enterprise checkbox features without design-partner pull.

---

## 6) Stage Evolution Model

Stage 1: Execution Guard Tool  
Stage 2: Execution Governance Platform  
Stage 3: AI Cost + Execution Observability Layer  
Stage 4: Optional Agent Runtime Platform  
Stage 5: Enterprise Trust + Compliance Platform

Mandatory rule:
- each stage must pass reliability and trust gates before next stage opens.

---

## 7) Current-State Alignment Audit (What We Have vs Blueprint)

### 7.1 Strongly Aligned (Keep and Expand)

1. Process-group teardown model and safety behavior.
2. Shadow-mode policy evaluation.
3. Append-only event foundation.
4. Benchmark corpus fixture coverage.
5. Strict CI checks (build/test/race/staticcheck/govulncheck).
6. Dashboard production build path.
7. Release checkpoint discipline.
8. Branch protection + required checks.
9. Onboarding usability test automation.
10. Security baselines (API key, constant-time compare, redaction, local bind defaults).

### 7.2 Partially Aligned (Refactor/Unify)

1. Multiple historical evidence tables still coexist (incidents/audit/decision/events).
2. Decision engine versioning is not yet formalized as first-class schema.
3. Policy lifecycle governance is not yet fully versioned.
4. Observability is useful but not yet SLO-governed at company ritual level.
5. Integration surface is still planned, not productized.

### 7.3 Misaligned or Premature (Defer/Remove from active build queue)

1. Any feature that introduces black-box action without reason trace.
2. Any expansion that bypasses release checkpoint + rollback discipline.
3. Any cross-cloud scope creep that weakens local-first deterministic value.
4. UI polish work that does not improve trust, explainability, or onboarding speed.

### 7.4 Remove-Unnecessary Directive

Operational interpretation of “remove unnecessary”:
1. remove active priority from non-core experiments that do not map to domains 1-5 or 8-9.
2. remove roadmap items lacking measurable reliability/trust impact.
3. remove docs ambiguity by keeping one authoritative path per operator workflow.

No destructive code removal is performed by this plan section alone.
Code deprecation/removal requires explicit PRs with rollback notes.

---

## 8) Prioritization Framework (Company-Level)

P0 (Now): Domain 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 9 fundamentals  
P1 (Next): Domain 5 and initial Domain 10 surface  
P2 (After proof): Domain 6 and selective Domain 7  
P3 (Long-range): extended enterprise programs after validated demand

Priority decision formula:
- user pain severity
- trust impact
- reliability risk
- evidence maturity
- operational burden

---

## 9) Governance Model

### 9.1 Product Governance

- Every feature requires: problem, scope, anti-goals, metrics, rollback path.
- No roadmap item enters sprint without measurable success criteria.

### 9.2 Reliability Governance

- Weekly reliability review is mandatory.
- Error budget policy determines feature freeze decisions.

### 9.3 Security Governance

- Security baseline checks are required for release.
- Vulnerability response timeline is documented and tracked.

### 9.4 Release Governance

- Feature freeze windows.
- Canary and soak windows.
- Rollback drill evidence.
- Public changelog discipline.

---

## 10) Internal Company Systems (Rituals)

A) Release Governance System  
B) Incident Command Structure  
C) Documentation-as-Product  
D) Telemetry Governance and Privacy  
E) Product Taxonomy Discipline

### 10.1 Incident Command Roles

- Incident Commander
- Communications Lead
- Root Cause Analyst
- Recovery Operator
- Follow-up Owner

### 10.2 Mandatory Incident Outputs

- Incident timeline
- User impact summary
- Root cause statement
- Corrective action list with owners/dates
- Regression test commitment

---

## 11) Visual Product Direction

Website must remain proof-driven.

Primary navigation:
- Product
- Solutions
- Reliability
- Security
- Docs
- Changelog
- Status
- Community
- Download

Homepage proof blocks:
1. Incident timeline demo.
2. Confidence decomposition panel.
3. Policy simulation snapshot.
4. Replay demonstration.
5. Operational trust evidence.

---

## 12) SLO and Error Budget Baseline

SLO Group A: Detection and Action
- detection latency p95
- intervention precision
- false positive ceiling

SLO Group B: Runtime Stability
- crash-free sessions
- clean shutdown success
- restart storm prevention

SLO Group C: API and Dashboard
- availability during active sessions
- timeline API correctness
- dashboard data freshness

Error budget policy:
- if budget burns above threshold: feature freeze + reliability sprint.

---

## 13) Security and Trust Baseline

Required baseline controls:
1. SBOM generation.
2. dependency/vuln scanning.
3. secret redaction.
4. local secure defaults.
5. signed release path roadmap.
6. disclosure policy and response SLA.

---

## 14) Telemetry and Privacy Baseline

1. local-first default.
2. explicit opt-in for any outbound telemetry.
3. documented data retention policy.
4. data deletion path.
5. encryption-at-rest for persisted sensitive data.

---

## 15) Documentation-as-Product System

Documentation classes:
1. Quickstart
2. Operational runbook
3. Incident response
4. Migration guides
5. Upgrade warnings
6. API contract references
7. Architecture deep dives
8. Why-did-this-happen explainability guides

Doc quality gates:
- every behavior change updates relevant docs.
- stale docs block release.

---

## 16) Commercial Direction (No SaaS requirement today)

Potential packaging layers:
1. Core local runtime package.
2. Team reliability bundle.
3. Enterprise trust and governance bundle.

Commercial principle:
- monetize trust + cost savings + operational certainty.

---

## 17) Alignment Decision for Existing Work (Keep / Realign / Pause)

### Keep (already valuable)
- strict CI
- release checkpoint
- benchmark corpus
- append-only event baseline
- policy shadow mode
- supervisor teardown hardening
- branch protection
- issue/postmortem templates

### Realign (keep but redesign)
- evidence model unification into canonical event contract
- decision-engine versioning and reproducibility
- formal SLO dashboard rituals

### Pause
- advanced runtime platform features not yet demanded by pilot users
- broad integration matrix beyond core design partners

---

## 18) 24-Month Milestone Timeline (High-Level)

Phase A (Month 0-3): Core Trust Lock
- domains 1-4 and 8-9 foundations hardened
- release/rollback rituals enforced

Phase B (Month 4-6): Operator Confidence
- explainability and observability improvements
- pilot reliability consistency

Phase C (Month 7-12): Expansion with Discipline
- selective integrations
- cost intelligence entry

Phase D (Month 13-18): Platform Consolidation
- policy governance maturity
- evidence export and compliance utilities

Phase E (Month 19-24): Enterprise Readiness Gate
- measured proof of reliability at scale
- controlled expansion decisions

---

## 19) Execution Rules (Founder Mandates)

1. No major new domain work while P0 reliability gates fail.
2. No integration expansion if explainability completeness < 100% for interventions.
3. No release if rollback drill evidence is stale.
4. No security exception without explicit risk acceptance note.
5. No roadmap inflation without metrics and owners.

## 26) Business Narrative and Funding Readiness

A defensible infrastructure company narrative requires:
1. unique execution-control boundary ownership
2. reproducible deterministic behavior
3. strong trust and evidence posture
4. measurable reliability outcomes
5. integration-led distribution model
6. clear cost/value angle

Funding narrative focus:
- execution control as mission-critical reliability layer for AI operations

---

## 27) Competitive Discipline

Rules:
1. do not copy breadth without matching operational quality.
2. out-compete on determinism + explainability + trust ritual.
3. preserve product clarity under growth pressure.

---

## 28) Decision Rubric for New Features

A feature is accepted only when all are true:
1. maps to one of the 10 domains
2. has measurable success criteria
3. has rollback path
4. does not degrade explainability
5. passes reliability risk review

---

## 29) Deletion and Simplification Policy

If a component fails to prove value for two cycles:
1. de-scope to experimental status
2. stop expansion
3. simplify or remove after explicit review

---

## 30) Leadership Operating Checklist

Daily:
- risk review
- blocker review

Weekly:
- reliability review
- customer signal review
- roadmap update

Bi-weekly:
- release readiness review

Monthly:
- architecture debt review
- security and threat model review

Quarterly:
- strategic scope reset
- kill underperforming bets

---

## 31) Roadmap Integrity Rules

1. Never promote roadmap items without owners.
2. Never call features “done” without acceptance evidence.
3. Never claim enterprise readiness without incident/release ritual proof.
4. Never inflate roadmap with unlabeled risk.

---

## 32) Final Master Goal

Build FlowForge into the trusted deterministic execution-control infrastructure standard for AI and automation workloads, with evidence-backed reliability and disciplined operations as the primary moat.

---

## 33) Immediate Execution Queue (Next 30 Days)

1. Unified event schema design doc and migration plan.
2. Policy canary and shadow governance controls.
3. SLO dashboard and error-budget operating doc.
4. First chaos drill with published findings.

3. qualitative artifacts have no unresolved `TODO`:
   - `external_feedback.md`
   - `observer_notes.md`
4. report shows `plan.md checkbox readiness: READY_TO_MARK_PLAN_CHECKBOX`.
5. evidence path is published in docs or release notes.
